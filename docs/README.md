Hi! This is the development repo of **Very Small Size Soccer Team** of [Pequi Mecânico](https://www.facebook.com/NucleoPMec/). Our team is composed by members of several courses (Eletrical Engineer, Computer Engineer, Software Engineer and Computer Science), all from Universidade Federal de Goiás - [UFG](https://www.ufg.br/) - Goiânia.

Our repository is open because we understand that our greatest job is to add our research and knowledge to the academic and industrial world.

We are open to answer any questions and suggestions through our email contato@pequimecanico.com. More informations can be acquired from our [site](https://pequimecanico.com/).
